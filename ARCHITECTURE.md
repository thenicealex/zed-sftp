# Architecture

## Overview

This SFTP extension for Zed uses a **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** approach to provide SFTP functionality. This is the same approach used by many Zed extensions and allows us to watch for file changes and trigger uploads.

## Components

### 1. Rust Extension (`src/lib.rs`)

The Rust extension is the entry point that Zed loads. It:

- Implements the `zed::Extension` trait
- Provides the `language_server_command` to start the Node.js language server
- Handles language server lifecycle management
- Passes configuration from Zed to the language server

### 2. Node.js Language Server (`server/`)

The language server is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. It:

- Implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- Watches for document save events (`textDocument/didSave`)
- Handles SFTP operations (upload, download, sync)
- Manages SFTP connections
- Provides command execution for manual operations

#### Key Files:

- **`server/src/index.ts`** - Main language server entry point
  - Sets up LSP connection
  - Handles document save events
  - Registers commands
  - Manages configuration

- **`server/src/sftp-client.ts`** - SFTP client wrapper
  - Wraps `ssh2-sftp-client` library
  - Handles connection management
  - Implements upload/download/sync operations
  - Manages authentication (SSH keys, passwords)

- **`server/src/config.ts`** - Configuration manager
  - Loads `.zed/sftp.json` configuration
  - Handles ignore patterns
  - Manages multiple profiles
  - Validates configuration

## How It Works

### Upload on Save Flow

```
1. User saves file in Zed
   ↓
2. Zed notifies language server via LSP (textDocument/didSave)
   ↓
3. Language server receives save event
   ↓
4. Check if uploadOnSave is enabled
   ↓
5. Check if file matches ignore patterns
   ↓
6. Connect to SFTP server (if not connected)
   ↓
7. Calculate remote path from local path
   ↓
8. Create remote directories if needed
   ↓
9. Upload file via SFTP
   ↓
10. Show notification in Zed
```

### Manual Command Flow

```
1. User runs command (e.g., "SFTP: Upload File")
   ↓
2. Zed sends executeCommand request to language server
   ↓
3. Language server receives command with arguments
   ↓
4. Execute appropriate SFTP operation
   ↓
5. Show result notification in Zed
```

## Why Language Server?

Using a language server provides several advantages:

1. **File Save Events** - LSP provides `textDocument/didSave` events
2. **Command Execution** - LSP supports custom commands
3. **Notifications** - Can show messages to users
4. **Logging** - Built-in logging to Zed's console
5. **Standard Protocol** - Well-documented and supported by Zed

## Comparison with VSCode Extension

| Feature | VSCode Extension | This Zed Extension |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| File watching | VSCode File System API | LSP didSave events |
| Commands | VSCode Commands API | LSP executeCommand |
| Configuration | VSCode Settings API | JSON file + LSP |
| UI | VSCode UI API | LSP notifications |
| SFTP Library | ssh2 (Node.js) | ssh2-sftp-client (Node.js) |

## Configuration Loading

The extension looks for configuration in this order:

1. `.zed/sftp.json` (Zed-specific)
2. `.vscode/sftp.json` (VSCode compatibility)
3. `sftp.json` (Root level)

This allows users to:
- Use Zed-specific configuration
- Share configuration with VSCode
- Keep configuration at project root

## Authentication

Supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **SSH Private Key** (Recommended)
   - Reads key from `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or custom path
   - Supports passphrase-protected keys
   - Requires a pinned server host fingerprint
   - Most secure method

2. **Password**
   - Stored in configuration file
   - Still requires a pinned server host fingerprint
   - Less secure, not recommended for production

## Connection Management

- Connections are established on-demand
- Connection is reused for multiple operations
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Configurable connection timeout

## Error Handling

- All SFTP operations wrapped in try-catch
- Errors logged to Zed console
- User-friendly error messages shown as notifications
- Connection errors trigger reconnection attempts

## Performance Considerations

1. **Concurrent Uploads** - Configurable concurrency limit
2. **Connection Pooling** - Single connection reused
3. **Ignore Patterns** - Skip unnecessary files
4. **Incremental Sync** - Only upload changed files

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **File Watcher** - Watch file system for changes (not just saves)
2. **Diff View** - Compare local and remote files
3. **Remote Explorer** - Browse remote files in Zed
4. **Progress Indicators** - Show upload/download progress
5. **FTP/FTPS Support** - Add FTP protocol support
6. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle file conflicts
7. **Bandwidth Throttling** - Limit transfer speed
8. **Transfer Queue** - Queue multiple transfers

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Build language server
cd server
npm install
npm run build

# Build Rust extension
cargo build --release
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test language server
cd server
npm test

# Test Rust extension
cargo test
```

### Debugging

1. **Language Server Logs**
   - Open Zed log: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "zed: open log"
   - Look for SFTP-related messages

2. **SFTP Operations**
   - Enable debug logging in configuration
   - Check connection details
   - Verify file paths

## Dependencies

### Rust Dependencies

- `zed_extension_api` - Zed extension API
- `serde` - JSON serialization
- `serde_json` - JSON parsing

### Node.js Dependencies

- `vscode-languageserver` - LSP implementation
- `vscode-languageserver-textdocument` - Text document handling
- `ssh2-sftp-client` - SFTP client library
- `chokidar` - File system watcher (future use)
- `minimatch` - Glob pattern matching

## Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Storage**
   - Never commit passwords to git
   - Use SSH keys when possible
   - Consider using environment variables

2. **File Permissions**
   - Set appropriate permissions on uploaded files
   - Respect remote server permissions

3. **Connection Security**
   - Use SFTP (SSH) instead of FTP when possible
   - Pin and verify server host fingerprints
   - Rotate keys deliberately and update the pinned fingerprint when needed
